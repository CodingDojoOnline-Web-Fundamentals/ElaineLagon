				<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
				<p>Okay, so where to start? I'm from Fort Worth, TX. I live with my mom and three cats:Bunny, Bumper, and Maddie. I work part-time for Shermco Industries, Inc in Irving, TX. It was back in 2002 that I first began my journey as a Web Designer.</p> 
				<br/>
				<p> It was my Senior Year and the instructor was going to be discussing Fireworks. Boy, was I so excited!I was very interested in how a webpage was created from scratch. After the first day, I was hooked. Literally. I went to Barnes and Nobles or was it Borders back then? Hmm...probably the latter. Anyway, I bought the software and set it up. I worked with files in Fireworks and really got into animation.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>After graduation, I went on to other colleges to pursue my dream. It was not until Lonestar College in the Woodlands, Tx that I started learning how to create HTML pages in DreamWeaver, or notepad. Well, it was some HTML text editor. 
				</p>
				 <p>And the rest is history!</p>
